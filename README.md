# See [jubatus-mpio](https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-mpio) instead

This frsyuki/mpio repository is suspended.

But thanks to an open-source project called [Jubatus](http://jubat.us/en/), mpio library is maintained as **jubatus-mpio**.
I recommend to check the repository instead:

https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-mpio

If you're looking for RPC (msgpack-rpc-cpp), here is the **jubatus-msgpack-rpc/cpp**:

https://github.com/jubatus/jubatus-msgpack-rpc/tree/master/cpp
